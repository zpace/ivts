.. rubric:: :header_no_toc:`ivts`

`ivts` is a python library designed to help you sample from weird distributions!

Introduction
------------

`ivts` supplies one base class, :class:`ivts.ivts.IVTSDist`, that transforms a number on :math:`(0, 1)` into a number drawn from a probability distribution corresponding to a user-supplied `inverse cumulative distribution function <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_transform_sampling>`_.
